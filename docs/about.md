# Electron Workshop

## Overview

Electron Workshop emerged in 2011 as a pioneering coworking space in Australia, crafted from a 1920s Bulla Cream truck workshop. For a decade, it served as a vibrant hub for digital creatives, entrepreneurs, and technologists, fostering innovation, collaboration, and a strong sense of community.

## Founding and History

### The Beginning

Founders Martin Gleeson (Marty) and Nick Jaffe transformed the historical Bulla Truck Workshop into Electron Workshop, envisioning a space that would not only accommodate the evolving needs of digital professionals but also serve as a community and event hub. Their efforts resulted in a coworking space that hosted an array of events, from meetups and movie screenings to workshops and talks, enriching the local ecosystem with opportunities for learning and collaboration.

### Growth and Community Impact

Over its ten years of operation, Electron Workshop became known for its open-plan design, flexible work arrangements, and comprehensive facilities, including high-speed internet, meeting rooms, and event spaces powered by 100% green energy. Its commitment to environmental and social responsibility resonated with members, making it a beacon for open-source organizations, tech startups, and progressive groups. The space was not just about work; it was about building a community that shared values of innovation, creativity, and inclusivity.

### The Pandemic and Closure

The COVID-19 pandemic posed significant challenges, leading to the difficult decision to close the physical space in March 2021. Despite this, the founders and community members celebrated the decade of memories, achievements, and the impact Electron Workshop had on the local tech and creative industries.

## Legacy and Transition

### The Future Vision

Electron Workshop has now entered a period of hibernation as it will start its transition, guided by close friends of Martin Gleeson and other people who has experience of the original values that Electron Workshop stood for.

The aim is now to reimagine Electron Workshop not as a physical coworking space but as an innovation acceleration network. This shift aims to adapt to the changing dynamics of work and collaboration in the post-pandemic world, while still holding true to the core values and community spirit of Electron Workshop.

### Innovation Acceleration Network

The envisioned innovation acceleration network seeks to extend the legacy of Electron Workshop beyond its physical confines. The focus will be on nurturing and supporting open-source organizations, progressive groups, tech startups, and human rights initiatives. Throughout its operation, Electron Workshop was a beacon for these communities, providing a platform for dialogue, collaboration, and innovation. By transforming into a network, Electron Workshop aims to amplify its impact, facilitating connections and support across a broader spectrum of projects and initiatives.

### Core Values and Legacy

At the heart of this transformation is the commitment to the core values that defined Electron Workshop:

- **Openness and Collaboration:** Continuing to support and promote open-source projects and collaborative efforts that drive innovation.
- **Progressive Initiatives:** Fostering a community that supports progressive organizations and movements, working towards social and environmental betterment.
